# 👋 Hi, I'm Naman Chandok

I'm a full stack developer based in New Delhi with 4+ years of experience building scalable web apps using React, Next.js and Node.js. I specialize in sleek front-end design, seamless API integrations, and machine learning algorithms using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. Currently a college student, I'm eager to build high-impact intelligent solution that actually make a difference.

When I'm not buried in code, I'm probably exploring the latest AI tools, chasing hackathon deadlines, or pretending to take a "quick break" that turns into a YouTube rabbit hole.

### Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS deployed with Github All text is set in the Space Grotesk typeface.
